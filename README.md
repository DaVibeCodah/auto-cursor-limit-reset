> **🚀 This is an automated fork**  
> Based on the original [cursor-limit-reset](https://github.com/yx-elite/cursor-limit-reset), this version adds:
> - **Background daemon** with system tray icon (green = active, red = paused)
> - **Automatic periodic reset** (every 30 minutes, configurable)
> - **One‑click toggle** – enable/disable auto‑reset from the tray
> - **Startup integration** – runs silently on login (Windows/macOS/Linux)
> - **`--revert` flag** – restore all settings from latest backup **except** the telemetry IDs (keeps fresh IDs)
>
> No terminal needed – just run once and it lives in your tray.  
> 👉 **See the “Automated Usage” section below for the new commands.**


## 🤖 Automated Usage (Fork Features)

1. **Run the daemon** (adds itself to startup):
   
       python cursor_reset.py
   
   A tray icon appears – green = auto‑reset on, red = off.

2. **Right‑click the tray icon** to:
   - Toggle auto‑reset on/off
   - Reset IDs immediately
   - Exit the daemon

3. **Revert settings except IDs** (close Cursor first):
   
       python cursor_reset.py --revert
   
   Restores every setting from the latest backup, but keeps your current fresh IDs.

All backups are timestamped and stored next to `storage.json`.
